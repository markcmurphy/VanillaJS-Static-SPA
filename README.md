**Is it mobile responsive?**

Yup! Though more time could be spent on refining it, the main navbar breaks into a hamburger with pop-out side-menu. If I had more time, I would likely make the track titles menu collapsable since it takes up a good bit of screen realestate. There is one breakpoint that favors vertical screens, so no dedicated tablet view is in place.
